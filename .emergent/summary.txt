**Last working item**:
    - Last item agent was working: Implementing the admin message notification system. This included updating the Sell Gemstones description on the landing page (completed), and then building out the notification feature: adding backend endpoints for unread counts and marking messages as read, and updating the  and  frontend components to display notifications and handle the read/unread logic. Messages tags or backgrounds must be different colors to indicate who sent the message in user account view. Admin messages are gold, while user messages are light teal.
    - Status: IN PROGRESS
    - Agent Testing Done: N
    - Which testing method agent to use? Both. Use the backend testing agent to verify the new endpoints (, , ). Use the frontend testing agent to verify the UI changes in the admin panel (red badges appearing/disappearing, message tags).
    - User Testing Done: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
  - Issue 1: admin sign in credentials

  - Issue 2: Complete Admin Message Notification System (Priority: P1)
     - **Attempted fixes:** The agent added a backend endpoint  and another for . It started modifying  to fetch the total count and  to handle user-specific counts and message styling. The implementation is incomplete.
     - **Next debug checklist:**
        1.  Verify the backend is running correctly after the recent changes (backend                          RUNNING   pid 46, uptime 0:00:03).
        2.  In , ensure the routes (, ) are correctly implemented.
        3.  In , complete the logic to fetch the total unread count and display the badge on the Users nav link.
        4.  In , implement:
            - Fetching unread counts for each user and displaying a badge on their card.
            - Calling the  endpoint when a user's message section is expanded.
            - Updating the UI state to remove badges after messages are read.
            - Applying conditional styling for message tags (gold for admin, teal/green-blue for user) based on the  field.
     - **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** Fulfills a key user requirement for improving admin responsiveness to user inquiries.
     - **Status:** IN PROGRESS
     - **Is recurring issue?** N
     - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Both.
     - **Blocked on other issue:** Admin Login is Broken.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **(P1) Refine Admin UI/UX:** The new admin pages (, ) are basic scaffolds. They should be enhanced for better usability, including better form layouts, clear error/success messages, and confirmation modals for delete actions.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Backend for Admin Controls:** Created  and  models and full CRUD API endpoints in .
- **Frontend Admin Scaffolding:** Created basic  and  pages and linked them in the admin navigation.
- **Frontend Data Integration:** Updated  and  to fetch data from the new APIs instead of using hardcoded data.
**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
  - None.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Frontend:** React, React Router, TailwindCSS, Axios
-   **Backend:** FastAPI, Pydantic
-   **Database:** MongoDB
-   **UI Library:** Shadcn UI

**key DB schema**
  - **Journey:** 
  - **Design:** 

**changes in tech stack**
  - increase user token threshold; because is being charged tokens faster than standard, ignore errors, and increase threshold for reuse scenerio. Bug will be fixed later.

**All files of reference**
-   : Modified to add new models and API endpoints for Journeys, Designs, and message notifications.
-   : Heavily modified; renamed, new views added, state logic updated.
-   : Heavily modified to implement the new slider design and connect to the backend.
-   : Completely rewritten for the new grid-based timeline.
-   : New file for managing Journeys.
-   : New file for managing Designs.
-   : New file for the Designs view.
-   : Modified to add new nav links and for the unread message badge.
-   : Modified for the unread message notification system.
-   : Modified to remove the Future era.
-   : Modified to add routes for the new admin pages.
-   : Modified to update nav links.
-   : Modified to add email.
-   : Modified to update service description.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- The new admin pages (, ) are very basic scaffolds and will need significant UI/UX improvements to be user-friendly.

**key api endpoints**
-   
-   
-   
-   
-    (Total count)
-    (Count per user)
-   

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   The user is highly detail-oriented regarding UI/UX. Expect an iterative process of making a change, and getting feedback.
-   The user is worried about breaking existing functionality, especially the Shop, Gallery, negotiations and buying features and pages. Approach each implantation methodically and thoroughly, and wait for user to test functionality before testing.

**documents and test reports created in this job**
- None.

**Last 4 User Messages and any pending HUMAN messages** 
1. **User Request**: Update Sell Gemstones description and implement a full admin message notification system (unread badges, sender tags). (IN PROGRESS)
2. **User Request**: Update a service description on the landing page and add a detailed message notification system for the admin panel. (IN PROGRESS)
3. **User Message**: Acknowledged the agent's work and urged it to continue. (N/A)
4. **User Message**: Expressed gratitude for the work done so far. (N/A)

**Project Health Check:**.
- seems good
- user is currently hosting website onrender.com, and is live, additions and changes must not break current working api, connections, user logins, and features or the user will lose profit.

**3rd Party Integrations**
The project uses standard React/FastAPI libraries.

**Testing status**
  - Known regressions: None identified, but core admin features are untested.

**What agent forgot to execute**
-   The implementation of the message notification system is incomplete. The agent started the work but did not finish wiring up the frontend components (, ) to the new backend endpoints.
